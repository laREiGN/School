## Description

The ability of software-engineers to analyze and solve problems and translate solutions into correct computer programs can be seen as important and fundamental skills. Throughout the study program as well as in a professional career, these skills will continuously be called upon.

## Introduction

This course is complementary to the development- and analyse courses. However, this course primarily focuses on the step-by-step implementation of a full computer program. This implementation will build upon the knowledge acquired in both development- and analyse courses. In addition, this course allows students new to programming to get familiar with the software development environment, the process of debugging software and the transformation of problem solutions to working code. The result of this will be a computer program, written by the student.

## Connection with other courses

This course is complementary to the development- and analyse courses, its goal is making new programmers feel familiar with solving programming tasks. Required prior knowledge are the concepts that were introduced in the above mentioned courses.

## Choice of programming language

Throughout this course, the Python programming language will be used.

## Target audience

The target audience of this course are students that are looking to get familiar with software development in practice. Students will be assisted yet challenged to use the concepts introduced in previous courses in programming.

## Evaluation

Throughout the length of the course the student will progressively solve programming tasks that lead to the implementation of functionality for a calculator. This calculator program is used to calculate problems and find solutions to problems as part of the weekly progress of the course. The end product is a working calculator program.

## Topics

The following topics are part of this course;

* The integrated development environment (IDE),
* the debugger and the process of debugging,
* operations on strings,
* operations on arrays,
* loops,
* additional topics, depending on experience levels.
