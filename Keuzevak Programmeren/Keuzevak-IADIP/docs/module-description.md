| Course name                | Introduction to Application Development in Python                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Description
-----------

The ability of software-engineers to analyze and solve problems and translate
solutions into correct computer programs can be seen as important and
fundamental skills. Throughout the study program as well as in a professional
career, these skills will continuously be called upon.

Introduction
------------

This course is complementary to the development- and analyse courses. However,
this course primarily focuses on the step-by-step implementation of a full
computer program. This implementation will build upon the knowledge acquired in
both development- and analyse courses. In addition, this course allows students
new to programming to get familiar with the software development environment,
the process of debugging software and the transformation of problem solutions to
working code. The result of this will be a computer program, written by the
student.

Connection with other courses
-----------------------------

This course is complementary to the development- and analyse courses, its goal
is making new programmers feel familiar with solving programming tasks. Required
prior knowledge are the concepts that were introduced in the above mentioned
courses.

Course material
---------------

1. Material for theoretical session (slides).
2. All material (digital and non-digital) distributed throughout the length of
    the course.
3. Description of assignments.

Choice of programming language
------------------------------

Throughout this course, the Python 3 programming language will be used. Due to
consistency and the automatic evaluation of the final assignment, we cannot
support other programming languages.

Schedule
--------

The length of this course is seven weeks, with one lesson of 100 minutes each
week. Students participating in this course will work on programming tasks
according to the schedule below. Weekly progress in terms of completion of the
programming tasks is part of the assessment of this course. The final assignment
will build upon all completed programming tasks. Each lesson will be divided
into two parts; a theoretical part, related to subject that will be applied in
the practical part of the lesson. Each lesson will be supervised by a teacher.
The programming tasks according to the schedule need to be completed and
approved by the teacher. Each programming task will contribute towards the final
assignment.

\* Depending on the experience levels of the students, the final software may be
improved to improve the grade. Depending on additional and optional criteria in
the assignment description.

Grades and Assessment
----------

The final results of this course will be determined according to the following
criteria.

-   Weekly progress (0% - 100%): The programming tasks need to be evaluated by
    the teacher on a weekly basis. The final assessment of this criterium is as
    follows: `Progress = Number of approved weeks / 5`

-   Final assignment (0% - 100%): The final assignment should be submitted through
    AutoGradr. The assessment of the final assignment is automatic according to
    the criteria of the assignment. The deadline for the final assignment will
    be announced during the course. Each successfully implemented requirement
    accounts for 1/19 point. Thus, The final assessment of this criterium is as
    follows: `Final assignment = Number of implemented requirements / 19`

The final grade will be determined according to the following formula.

`Grade = Progress * 3 + Final assignment * 7`

`Grade = numberOfWeeks/5 * 3 + numberOfRequirements/19 * 7`

Example grade calculation:

Student has implemented all mandatory requirements and has shown weekly progress each time. So he has 5 out of 5 weeks, and implemented the 13 mandatory requirements out of the total of 19 requirements:

`(5/5) * 3 + (13/19) * 7 = 7.8`

__Assignments both weekly and final are individual work. In case of plagiarism student(s) will be reported to the exam committee.__

### Retake

Should the grade of the final assessment be insufficient, there will be an
opportunity to retake. The deadline for this retake will be announced during the
course.

__The grade received for the weekly progression will be maintained for the retake.__
